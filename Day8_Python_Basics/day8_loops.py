# Example: loops in Python

# For loop: repeat a task a fixed number of times
for day in range(1, 6):
    print(f"📘 Day {day} - Keep learning, Scott!")

print("✅ Great! You finished a 5-day study streak.\n")

# While loop: run until a condition becomes false
hours = 0
while hours < 3:
    hours += 1
    print(f"⏰ Hour {hours}: Keep studying...")

print("🎉 You've completed 3 focused hours today!")
