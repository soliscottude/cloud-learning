# Day 8 – Python Basics (Variables, Conditions and Loops)

## 🎯 Goals
- Learn Python syntax and basic logic flow.
- Practice user input, conditional statements, and loops.
- Prepare for writing small automation scripts later.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
### 1️⃣ Variables and User Input (`day8_variables.py`)
- Declared variables and received user input using `input()`.
- Practiced string concatenation and f-strings for formatted output.

### 2️⃣ Conditional Statements (`day8_if_else.py`)
- Used `if / elif / else` to make decisions based on study hours.
- Learned comparison operators (`>`, `>=`, `==`, etc.).

### 3️⃣ Loops (`day8_loops.py`)
- Wrote `for` loops using `range()`.
- Created `while` loops to repeat actions until conditions are met.


---

## 📝 Notes
- Indentation matters in Python.
- `range(1, 6)` → loops 1 to 5 (`end` excluded).
